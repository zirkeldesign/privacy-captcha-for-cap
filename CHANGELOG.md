# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **French translation (`fr_FR`).** Contributed by [@loxK](https://github.com/loxK) (Laurent Dinclaux, Gecka) in [#23](https://github.com/zirkeldesign/privacy-captcha-for-cap/pull/23), their first contribution to the plugin. Thank you! All 131 strings, tested on a French site with the settings page, the dashboard widget and the inline widget in a Contact Form 7 form. The WASM source label that changed in 1.4.0 was added on top.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- **Site keys using the `hashwx` protocol could not be solved.** Cap Standalone 3.1 creates new site keys with `protocol: "hashwx"` by default (`keyDefaults` in `standalone/src/server.js`). The vendored cap-widget 0.1.56 only knew `sha256-pow`, `rsw` and `instrumentation` and aborted with *"unsupported format-2 protocol 'hashwx'"*, so every form protected by such a key was unsubmittable. cap-widget is now 0.1.58, which adds the hashwx solver. Verified end to end against a freshly created default key on Cap 3.1.14 (Gravity Forms submit accepted, counted as verified on the Cap server), and against sha256-pow keys on both 3.1.14 and an older 3.x instance.

### Added

- `assets/wasm/hashwx.wasm`, vendored verbatim from `@cap.js/wasm@0.0.8` by `scripts/build-assets.mjs` alongside `cap_wasm_bg.wasm`. hashwx has **no JS fallback**: if the widget cannot load this file it fails the challenge outright, and since the build strips the widget's jsdelivr fallback, `window.CAP_CUSTOM_HASHWX_URL` must always be set. `Asset\Enqueuer` now emits it next to `CAP_CUSTOM_WASM_URL`.
- `Settings::getSelfHostedHashwxUrl()`, resolved through the same *WASM source* setting as the sha256 solver (bundled copy, or `<endpoint>/assets/hashwx.wasm` on the Cap server). The widget only fetches it when a challenge actually uses hashwx.
- `cap_captcha_hashwx_url` filter, the hashwx counterpart of `cap_captcha_wasm_url`.

### Changed

- `@cap.js/wasm` 0.0.7 to 0.0.8. `cap_wasm_bg.wasm` is byte-identical.
- The *Cap server* WASM source label now names the `/assets/` directory instead of a single file, since both solvers are loaded from there.
- Kept the `cap-widget` package name rather than switching to `@cap.js/widget`: upstream publishes the same build under both names (`widget/build.js`), and the docs still install `cap-widget`.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-08-13 (never tagged; shipped as part of 1.4.0)

### Changed

- **`Tested up to: 7.1`.** Verified against WordPress 7.1-RC3, not asserted: Plugin Check on the built zip reports 0 errors and 0 warnings, the Gravity Forms integration suite passes against real Gravity Forms 2.10.5 on 7.1, and the widget still renders on `wp-login.php`, the registration form and the comment form — the `login_footer` script-module printing (see `Asset/Enqueuer`) being the fragile part, since `WP_Script_Modules::add_hooks()` does not cover wp-login. None of the 7.1 breaking changes apply: the plugin registers no blocks, ships no editor JS, has no `@wordpress/*` dependency, touches neither the media pipeline nor the admin toolbar, and its only jQuery use is core `jQuery` inside the Gravity Forms field-settings panel — not jQuery UI.

### Added

- `bin/plugin-check.sh` (`composer pcp`) — builds the distribution zip and runs the real WordPress.org Plugin Check against **the zip** on a throwaway SQLite-backed WordPress, failing on any error or warning. Replaces the old `composer plugin-check`, which checked whatever happened to be active in an existing install and so never saw the files the dist script adds or `.distignore` removes. `WP_VERSION=7.1-RC3 composer pcp` targets a specific core, so a release candidate can be tested before readme.txt claims compatibility with it.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- **Fatal error on Gravity Forms 3.0 and newer.** GF 3.0 made both parameters of `GF_Field::get_field_label()` optional; our override still declared them as required, which PHP rejects as an incompatible signature — every request died with *"Declaration of … must be compatible with GF_Field::get_field_label(\$force_frontend_label = true, \$value = '')"*. Both parameters now carry GF 3's defaults, which is equally valid on GF 2.x (it always passes both arguments). The parent's return value is cast, since `GF_Field::get_field_label()` can return a null label. `php-stubs/gravity-forms-stubs` has no 3.x release, so PHPStan cannot see this drift — `tests/Unit/GfFieldSignatureTest.php` pins the contract instead, and the `GF_Field` stand-in in `tests/bootstrap.php` now mirrors the GF 3 signature so a regression fails to load in the test suite as well.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed
- **Multi-page Gravity Forms were unprotected or unsubmittable.** `gform_validation` fires on every page transition, but `cap-token` is a plain POST field written into the form by `<cap-widget>` — not a form value — and Gravity Forms re-renders the whole form (all pages, inactive ones hidden) on each transition, so the solved token never survives to the final submit. `Validator` demanded a proof on every page regardless. On forms with a preview step (e.g. the Gravity Wiz *GP Preview Submission* perk, which is a page break plus `{all_fields}` on the last page) the CAPTCHA could therefore never be satisfied: fail-closed made the form unsubmittable, fail-open made the CAPTCHA decorative. `Validator` is now page-aware — it requires the proof exactly when the page holding the field was submitted, or on the final submit — and `VerifiedState` carries an earlier page's verification across the rest of the submission via a short-lived transient keyed on GF's `gform_unique_id`.
- **Fail-open no longer waives a missing token.** `TokenVerifier::verifyToken('')` routed an empty token through `failOpen()`, so a site with fail-open enabled accepted *every* tokenless submission on *every* surface — the CAPTCHA became optional. Fail-open now means what `readme.txt` and the settings UI have always said it means: it applies only when the Cap server is genuinely unreachable. The not-configured short-circuit is unchanged.

### Added
- **Integration test suite** (`tests/Integration`, `composer test:integration`) running against a real WordPress + Gravity Forms via `GFFormDisplay::process_form()`, so the paging logic the validator mirrors is GF's own. Six of its twelve cases fail against the pre-fix code. The fixture is provisioned by `scripts/integration-env.sh` (SQLite, no MySQL, no Gravity Perks); Cap is faked through `pre_http_request` so the suite stays offline. Not wired into CI — Gravity Forms is commercial and would need its licence as a repository secret.
- `cap_captcha_require_token($required, $context)` filter — opt a surface out of the empty-token block for flows that legitimately submit without our widget.
- `cap_captcha_gf_field_page($page, $form)` filter — move the auto-injected Gravity Forms field off the last page (useful when that page can be hidden by conditional logic).
- `cap_captcha_gf_verified_ttl($seconds)` filter — how long a verification stays valid across the pages of one submission (default one hour).
- `cap_captcha_gf_skipped_hidden($formId, $fieldId)` action — fires when enforcement is skipped because conditional logic hid the CAPTCHA field.

### Changed
- The CAPTCHA now keeps a margin below itself on `wp-login.php` when something follows it, instead of sitting flush against the submit button.
- `gform_validation` is now registered with two arguments; `GFAPI::submit_form()` and validation-only API calls (`api-submit` / `api-validate`) are no longer gated, since no browser could have solved a challenge.
- Failing Gravity Forms validation now sets `failed_validation_page`, so the visitor lands on the page that actually holds the widget.
- The Login, Registration, and Comments integrations bail out on REST, XML-RPC, WP-CLI and cron requests, and on posts that lack the marker field of the form we render into (`wp-submit` / `comment_post_ID`). Without this the fail-closed change above would have broken XML-RPC logins, the REST comments endpoint, and third-party login forms.
## [1.2.5] - 2026-08-10 (never tagged; shipped as part of 1.3.0)

### Fixed
- **Deactivating a form plugin could silently disable its protection.** A card whose plugin is inactive renders as a disabled checkbox, and disabled checkboxes are not submitted — but the sanitize callback read the POST alone, so saving *any* setting stored that integration as off. Deactivate Gravity Forms for an upgrade, save an unrelated setting, reactivate it, and the forms came back unprotected with the box unticked and no warning. Integrations whose plugin is unavailable now keep their stored value, matching how the `wp-config` constant-backed keys already behaved.
- The Gravity Forms integration no longer defaults to **on**. That was a leftover from when the plugin was Gravity Forms-only, and it left the card ticked on installs with no Gravity Forms at all. It now defaults to off like every other surface.

## [1.2.4] - Unreleased

### Changed
- **The plugin no longer needs Composer to run.** `composer.json` requires nothing but PHP itself, so `vendor/` only ever held Composer's autoloader mapping `ZirkelDesign\CapCaptcha\` onto `src/`. That mapping now lives in `autoload.php`, used whenever `vendor/autoload.php` is absent. Consequences: a plain copy of the repository runs as-is (so the 1.2.3 "missing autoloader" notice is gone — it can no longer happen), `vendor/` is excluded from the package via `.distignore`, and `deploy.yml` and the `dist` script drop their `composer install --no-dev` steps. The fallback keeps deferring to Composer when it is present, so a future runtime dependency still works — `AutoloadMappingTest` fails if one is added without revisiting the packaging.
- Release builds are attached to the GitHub release. Previously the Releases page offered only GitHub's auto-generated source archive, which is not an installable plugin.

### Fixed
- Refreshed the vendored `pako_inflate.min.js`, which had been left at 2.1.0 when `9d04c10` bumped the pinned dependency to 2.2.0. The shipped copy now matches `package.json` again, as `bun run build:check` requires.
- `.distignore` excluded `dist/` but not the integration-test WordPress install, and the pattern for Composer's `vendor/` also matched `assets/js/vendor/`. Both were caught by building and inspecting the zip: the first inflated it from 92 KB to 28 MB, the second silently dropped `cap-widget.js` and would have shipped a plugin with no widget at all.

## [1.2.3] - Unreleased

### Fixed
- **The plugin did nothing unless Gravity Forms was active** ([#11](https://github.com/zirkeldesign/privacy-captcha-for-cap/issues/11)). The entry file gated `Plugin::boot()` behind `class_exists('GFForms') || class_exists('GFAPI')` — a leftover from before `01bc7e6` rebuilt the Gravity Forms-only plugin into a multi-surface one. Without Gravity Forms nothing booted: no **Settings → Privacy CAPTCHA for Cap** page, and no comments, login, registration or WooCommerce protection either. `Plugin::boot()` has always asked each integration whether its host plugin is present (`Integration::isAvailable()`), so the outer gate was both wrong and redundant; it and its "requires Gravity Forms" admin notice are gone. This matches what `readme.txt` already documented: *"Gravity Forms 2.5+ (only if you enable the Gravity Forms integration)"*.
- A copy installed straight from the source repository (which ships no `vendor/`, so nothing is autoloadable) now shows an explanatory admin notice instead of dying with a class-not-found fatal. The release zips from WordPress.org and the GitHub Releases page are unaffected — they bundle the autoloader.

## [1.2.2] - Unreleased

### Fixed
- An enabled surface no longer blocks submissions when the plugin is **not configured**. `TokenVerifier::verifyToken()` previously routed the not-configured case through `failOpen()` (fail-closed by default), so with e.g. the Login surface on but no endpoint/site key/secret set, logins failed with "CAPTCHA verification failed" while no widget was even rendered. It now returns early as a pass — protection stays off until configured.

## [1.2.1] - Unreleased

### Fixed
- WooCommerce checkout **account creation** no longer fails the CAPTCHA. `woocommerce_registration_errors` fires during checkout (via `wc_create_new_customer()`) as well as on the My Account register form, but the widget only renders on the latter; `verifyRegistration` now bails unless the register form's `woocommerce-register-nonce` is present (mirroring `verifyLostPassword`).
- The Login integration's WooCommerce-login skip guard checked a non-existent `woocommerce-login` field; corrected to `woocommerce-login-nonce`, so core Login verification no longer runs on WooCommerce My Account logins (which previously could block them when `woocommerce_login` was off but the Login surface was on).

## [1.2.0] - Unreleased

### Added
- **Per-surface fail-open.** Each surface can override the global fail-open with **Default / Fail-open / Fail-closed** (e.g. let logins through during a Cap outage but always require a valid proof on contact forms). New `cap_captcha_fail_open($open, $context)` filter.
- **`CapVerifier::check()`** returns `VerificationResult::{Verified,Rejected,Unreachable}`. Fail-open now applies **only** when Cap is unreachable (or there is no token) — an actively rejected token always blocks, even on a fail-open surface.
- **Fail-open annotations.** Submissions accepted during an outage are tagged `cap_captcha_fail_open = 1`: Gravity Forms entry meta, WooCommerce order meta + order note, comment meta, registration user meta. A `cap_captcha_fail_open_pass($context, $data)` action fires for custom handling.

### Changed
- `TokenVerifier` threads the surface `$context` through every integration and exposes `wasLastFailOpen()`.
- The Gravity Forms validator now defers an empty token to the surface's fail-open policy instead of always blocking.

## [1.1.0] - Unreleased

### Added
- **Contact Form 7** integration: injects the widget via `wpcf7_form_elements` and rejects unverified submissions through the `wpcf7_spam` gate.
- **CF7 placement control**: a `[cap_captcha]` form-tag for manual placement and a mode setting — **Automatic** (all forms, with per-form opt-out via the `cap_captcha: off` Additional Setting) or **Manual** (only forms carrying the tag). Verification is scoped to protected forms, so legally required / accessibility-sensitive forms left without the CAPTCHA are never blocked.
- **GF placement control**: a global "protect all Gravity Forms" setting and a per-form **Default / Always / Never** override in the form settings. Auto-protected forms get a synthetic `cap_captcha` field injected at runtime (via `gform_pre_render` / `gform_pre_validation` / `gform_pre_submission_filter`) so render and validation reuse the existing field path.
- **WooCommerce My Account** surfaces: login (`woocommerce_login`), registration (`woocommerce_registration`), and lost password (`woocommerce_lost_password`), each an independent toggle alongside checkout (`woocommerce_checkout`). A WooCommerce **master toggle** (`woocommerce`) gates all four — surfaces are picked in the master card's options disclosure in settings. The legacy `woocommerce` value maps to master-on + `woocommerce_checkout`.
- **Dashboard widget** (`Admin\DashboardWidget`) reusing the extracted `Status\StatusPanel` to show cached Cap server stats with a link to settings.
- **Per-surface protection model**: `Settings::isProtected($context)` gates every render and verification, exposed via the `cap_captcha_protect` and `cap_captcha_protect_{context}` filters. Granular settings toggles for all nine surfaces.

### Changed
- Integrations now register unconditionally when available and gate each render/verify on `isProtected()`, so the per-surface toggles and filters control behaviour at request time.
- `TokenVerifier` memoises verification per token within a request, preventing a single-use token from being redeemed twice when multiple hooks fire (e.g. WooCommerce login).
- Extracted the status panel rendering out of `Settings` into `Status\StatusPanel`.

### Fixed
- The Login integration no longer runs on WooCommerce My Account logins (detected via the `woocommerce-login` nonce), which previously could block them; the `woocommerce_login` surface owns that form.

### Migration
- The legacy single `woocommerce` toggle maps to `woocommerce_checkout` automatically.

## [1.0.0] - Unreleased

### Added
- Initial release as **Privacy CAPTCHA for Cap** (renamed from "Cap CAPTCHA for Gravity Forms").
- Top-level **Settings → Privacy CAPTCHA for Cap** page with per-integration toggles.
- **Comments** integration (`comment_form_after_fields` + `preprocess_comment`).
- **Login** integration (`login_form` + `wp_authenticate_user`).
- **Registration** integration (`register_form` + `registration_errors`).
- **WooCommerce checkout** integration (auto-detected, only loads when WC is active).
- **Programmatic display mode** — auto-solves the challenge in the background, no user interaction.
- **WASM source** setting (bundled / your own Cap server) with bundled as the default — both served from your own infrastructure.
- **Fail-open** behavior toggle for resilience during Cap-server outages.
- **`CAP_CAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`** constant override so the secret can live in `wp-config.php`.
- Fully self-hosted front-end assets: bundled `@cap.js/wasm@0.0.7` plus the `pako` decompression library and the cap-widget script, all served from the plugin. The jsdelivr fallback URLs baked into the upstream widget bundle are stripped at build time and the plugin sets `window.CAP_PAKO_URL` / `window.CAP_CUSTOM_WASM_URL` to local copies, so no third-party CDN is contacted at runtime.
- German (`de_DE`) translations for the new settings strings.
- Architecture refactor: shared `Asset\Renderer`, `Asset\Enqueuer`, `Verification\TokenVerifier`, and an `Integration\Integration` contract.
