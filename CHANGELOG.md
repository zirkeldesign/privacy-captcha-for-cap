## [1.0.0] - Unreleased

### Added
- Initial release as **Privacy CAPTCHA for Cap** (renamed from "Cap CAPTCHA for Gravity Forms").
- Top-level **Settings → Privacy CAPTCHA for Cap** page with per-integration toggles.
- **Comments** integration (`comment_form_after_fields` + `preprocess_comment`).
- **Login** integration (`login_form` + `wp_authenticate_user`).
- **Registration** integration (`register_form` + `registration_errors`).
- **WooCommerce checkout** integration (auto-detected, only loads when WC is active).
- **Programmatic display mode** — auto-solves the challenge in the background, no user interaction.
- **WASM source** setting (bundled / Cap server / jsdelivr) with bundled as the default.
- **Fail-open** behavior toggle for resilience during Cap-server outages.
- **`CAP_CAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`** constant override so the secret can live in `wp-config.php`.
- Bundled `@cap.js/wasm@0.0.7` so the WebAssembly module is served from the plugin, not jsdelivr.
- German (`de_DE`) translations for the new settings strings.
- Architecture refactor: shared `Asset\Renderer`, `Asset\Enqueuer`, `Verification\TokenVerifier`, and an `Integration\Integration` contract.
